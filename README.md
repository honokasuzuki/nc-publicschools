# NC Public Schools School Report Card - Adaptation

Each academic year, the NC School Board of Education releases a public report on all NC public schools' performance. Each school is given a letter grade from A-F and a numerical score from 0-100. These performance grades are determined by the schools’ students’ achievements in standardized tests, mastery over core subject areas, and college preparedness. In addition, the report card contains information such as school demographics, data on student behavior, school finances, school resources, and school personnel experience and qualifications.

This project is an adaptation of the currently existing School Report Card (https://ncreportcards.ondemand.sas.com/src). My goal is to turn this into something more compact and user-friendly, where all the information can be viewed in one page and users can easily change views from one district to another. For this dashboard, I am focusing on allowing users to explore individual district statistics in relation to state statistics on school environment and academic performance, rather than presenting all of the available information from the SRC. This decision was motivated by findings from literature reviews conducted on the relationship between school climate and student achievement.

The first “step” of the dashboard is to select a district, which users can select by clicking on a dot from a symbol map, where each dot represents a single district. The color of the dot is representative of the district’s average School Performance Score, so the initial motivation to explore a district can be the district’s overall academic performance. When a district is selected, further details about the district’s performance and school climate appears on the dashboard. From there, the user is free to explore the information that is displayed by observing patterns in these two areas of school characteristics.

This was created for a course titled Data Visualization, Society, and Student Learning.
